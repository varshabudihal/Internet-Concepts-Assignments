      <p>You tend to make mistakes and then you realize that it ain't that big to spend so much time regreting.Once you go out and travel, you get to know the importance of life and you tend to priortize things which really makes sense to you. Traveling for me is like meditation.
      My travelling history started with me getting really angry with the situations and people around me. This frustration made me take a decision to travel alone and then there it was.. what you call ..peace! </p>
      <p> I have traveled almost every part of India. By traveling so much it has made me capable of adjusting into situations where you have to give away your comfort zone to get moving. </p>
